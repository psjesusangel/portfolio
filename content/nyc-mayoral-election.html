<p>This analysis examines the geographic and demographic patterns behind Zohran Mamdani's unexpectedly strong performance in the 2025 NYC Democratic mayoral primary, using precinct-level election results merged with Census data.</p>

<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Is Mamdani's coalition primarily defined by class, education, race, or a combination of these factors?</li>
    <li>Can economic populism build winning coalitions in diverse urban environments?</li>
    <li>What does this reveal about the "moderate vs. progressive" divide in Democratic politics?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Merged NYC Board of Elections precinct-level results with Census demographic data</li>
    <li>Analyzed correlations between vote share and economic indicators (median income, poverty rates, unemployment)</li>
    <li>Examined educational attainment patterns across different levels of Mamdani support</li>
    <li>Investigated racial and ethnic composition of strongest-performing precincts</li>
    <li>Used regression analysis to identify which factors best predict Mamdani support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mamdani's coalition defies simple categorization—it's not just "young educated progressives" or "working-class voters"</li>
    <li>Support is strongest in areas combining economic distress with educational attainment</li>
    <li>The coalition spans multiple racial and ethnic communities, suggesting multiracial urban populism is viable</li>
    <li>Geographic patterns show strength in diverse urban neighborhoods rather than concentrated in any single demographic enclave</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>These results challenge conventional wisdom about progressive politics in diverse cities. Rather than choosing between economic populism and cultural progressivism, Mamdani's performance suggests candidates can build broad coalitions by appealing across traditional dividing lines. This has implications for Democratic strategy nationally, particularly in diverse urban areas.</p>
