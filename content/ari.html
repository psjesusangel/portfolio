<p>Ari is a minimalist habit tracking application built as a native macOS app, designed around the philosophy that our habits define us more than our one-time achievements.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Infinite canvas interface for spatial organization of habits</li>
    <li>Minimal UI that stays out of the way—focus on doing, not managing</li>
    <li>No gamification, streaks, or artificial motivation—just honest tracking</li>
    <li>Philosophy-driven: excellence through consistent action, not perfection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Journey</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Started as a web application using JavaScript and Canvas API</li>
    <li>Evolved into a native macOS application for better performance and integration</li>
    <li>Implemented smooth panning, zooming, and gesture controls for the infinite canvas</li>
    <li>Built custom data persistence to maintain habit history locally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Place habits anywhere on an infinite canvas</li>
    <li>Simple check-in system without overwhelming statistics</li>
    <li>Visual patterns emerge naturally from your tracking behavior</li>
    <li>Offline-first with local data storage</li>
</ul>

<p>The project represents a shift from typical productivity apps that rely on external motivation (points, streaks, social features) to one that simply provides a calm space for building sustainable habits.</p>
