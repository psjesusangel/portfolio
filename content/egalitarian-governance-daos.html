<p>Conducted research on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structures, focusing on identifying DAOs that implement egalitarian (one-person-one-vote) systems rather than the typical plutocratic token-weighted voting.</p>

<h2>Research Context</h2>
<p>Most DAOs use token-weighted voting where voting power is proportional to token holdings, creating plutocratic governance structures. This research investigated whether genuinely egalitarian DAOs exist and how they function in practice.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Used an internal dashboard tool to filter and analyze DAO governance data</li>
    <li>Identified candidate DAOs by filtering for Gini coefficient = 0 (perfect equality in voting power distribution)</li>
    <li>Collected a dataset of 60+ potentially egalitarian DAOs across platforms (Snapshot, DeepDAO, etc.)</li>
    <li>Conducted qualitative analysis of each DAO's governance documentation, proposals, and voting records</li>
    <li>Hand-labeled DAOs into categories based on their actual governance mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis Framework</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Egalitarian Governance Score (1-5):</strong> Based on actual voting mechanisms observed in practice</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Identification Score (1-5):</strong> Based on how DAOs describe their governance in documentation</li>
    <li>Evaluated evidence from proposals, voting records, white papers, and community discussions</li>
    <li>Documented contradictions between stated governance ideals and implemented systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Very few DAOs truly implement one-person-one-vote despite rhetoric about decentralization</li>
    <li>Many DAOs with egalitarian rhetoric still use token-weighted voting in practice</li>
    <li>Some DAOs (like Fractaller) showed evidence of genuine egalitarian voting but lacked sustained activity</li>
    <li>The gap between stated values and implemented systems reveals tensions in DAO governance design</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Cases</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ether.fi:</strong> Token-weighted staking model (Score: 1) despite decentralization claims</li>
    <li><strong>Fractaller:</strong> One FRC per vote in proposals (Score: 4) but minimal documentation and single proposal</li>
    <li><strong>Study DAO:</strong> Appeared to be testing/learning project with plutocratic voting</li>
</ul>

<p>The research highlighted the challenge of implementing truly egalitarian governance in crypto-native organizations where token economics often conflict with democratic ideals.</p>
