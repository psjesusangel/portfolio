<p>As a Software Developer at Yale School of Medicine's Levy Neuro Decision Lab, I designed and built full-stack web applications for behavioral psychology research, enabling researchers to collect data on decision-making under risk and uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Built modular, reusable JavaScript experiment frameworks using Node.js and Express</li>
    <li>Implemented MongoDB for participant data storage and real-time experiment tracking</li>
    <li>Created flexible configuration systems allowing researchers to modify experiments without touching code</li>
    <li>Developed responsive interfaces ensuring consistent participant experience across devices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Preference Studies:</strong> Interactive surveys measuring risk attitudes across different decision contexts, with randomized question ordering and adaptive feedback</li>
    <li><strong>Image Valuation Experiments:</strong> Custom interfaces for participants to rate and value images, with randomized slider positioning to reduce anchoring bias</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-stage Decision Tasks:</strong> Complex experiments involving sequential choices and probabilistic outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Impact</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Served 500+ participants across multiple studies</li>
    <li>Provided researchers with clean, well-structured data for analysis</li>
    <li>Enabled rapid iteration on experimental designs based on pilot results</li>
    <li>Created reusable components that accelerated development of new experiments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ensuring randomization and counterbalancing worked correctly across sessions</li>
    <li>Building systems robust enough for participants with varying technical skills</li>
    <li>Managing participant flow and data integrity across multi-session studies</li>
    <li>Creating intuitive interfaces that didn't bias decision-making behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>The work required balancing technical rigor with psychological validity—every implementation decision had to consider its potential impact on participant behavior and data quality.</p>
